There lived a twin brother called Sam and Tom! They were identical twins, even their mother found it too hard to differentiate between them during the initial months of birth. ~4 ~1 were like two poles when it comes to everything other than their appearance. They neither agree with anything nor do ~1 share even one single trait!

Sam had no friends, whereas for Tom the world was friendship. Sam loved sweets and Tom loved to eat spicy foods. Sam was mommy’s pet and Tom was daddy’s pet. While Sam was generous, Tom was greedy!

As ~1 grew up, their father wanted to share his fortune equally. ~4 Tom did not agree and he argued that whoever is more intelligent and strong, will gain higher share of wealth than other.

Sam agreed. Their father decided to organize a competition between the two. And ~1 ordered the two sons to walk as long as ~1 can in and ~1 should ~3 ~2 before the sunset. Whoever covers the longer ~0 and returns ~2 before sunset will get huge amount of wealth proportionate to the ~0 ~1 covered. They don’t carry watch to calculate time.

Both started to walk a long way during a sunny day. Sam walked slowly and steadily, while Tom urged to win over Sam started to run instantly.

The ~0 ~1 cover until mid-noon will be equal to the ~0 ~1 would reach ~2 before sunset. It was mid-noon and Sam decided to ~3 back as he could reach ~2 on time.

~4 Tom, with his greediness to earn more wealth, did not turn his way back ~2 even after mid-noon. He walked two times longer ~0 that what Sam was covered and decided to ~3 back before the sunset. He urged to ~3 ~2 as the Sun turned orange in the evening. Unfortunately, he could not even make half way to ~2 and the moon rises.

He lost the race and was defeated because of greediness!

GREEDINESS WILL MAKE YOU LOSE EVERYTHING
